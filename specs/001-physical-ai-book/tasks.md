# Tasks: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Educational Book

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-physical-ai-book/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested - focusing on build verification and content validation.

**Organization**: Tasks are organized to enable incremental delivery:
- Phase 1: Setup (shared infrastructure)
- Phase 2: Foundational (blocking prerequisites)
- Phase 3+: Content organized by user story priority
- Final Phase: Polish and deployment

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all content
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational - Core MVP content
- **User Stories 2-3 (Phases 4-5)**: Can start after US1 Introduction complete
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on ALL modules in US1 complete
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Can start after Foundational; independent of content
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories complete

### User Story Dependencies

    Setup[Phase 1: Setup] --> Found[Phase 2: Foundational]
    Found --> US1[Phase 3: US1 Core Content]
    US1 --> US2[Phase 4: US2 Search]

    US5 --> Polish
```

### Parallel Opportunities

Within each phase, tasks marked [P] can run in parallel:

**Phase 1 (Setup):**
```
T003, T004 can run in parallel (different config sections)
T006, T007 can run in parallel (different files)
```

**Phase 2 (Foundational):**
```
T010, T011, T012, T013, T014 can ALL run in parallel (different folders)
```

**Phase 3 (US1 Content) - Per Module:**
```
After chapter .md created:
- Code examples [P] can run in parallel
- Diagrams [P] can run in parallel
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Complete US1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational
3. Complete Phase 3: US1 Core Content (Introduction + All 4 Modules)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test site navigation, content rendering
5. Deploy MVP to GitHub Pages

**MVP Deliverable**: Complete educational book with 4 modules, ~16,000 words

### Incremental Enhancement

1. MVP Complete → Deploy
2. Add US2: Search optimization → Test search
3. Add US3: Code example polish → Test copy/paste
4. Add US4: Capstone project → Test cross-references
5. Add US5: Resources section → Test external links
6. Final Polish → Production deployment

### Content Writing Order (Within US1)

1. Introduction (sets context for all modules)
2. Module 1: ROS 2 (foundational robotics concepts)
3. Module 2: Simulation (builds on ROS 2)
4. Module 3: Isaac (integrates ROS 2 + Simulation)
5. Module 4: VLA (highest-level integration)

Each module: Chapter 1 → Chapter 2 → Chapter 3 → Chapter 4 → Learning outcomes/assessments

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Word counts are targets; adjust as needed while maintaining 15,000-20,000 total
- Code examples should target ROS 2 Jazzy and Isaac Sim 4.x
- All chapters MUST include: learning outcomes, main content, code examples, self-assessment
- Commit after each chapter or logical group of tasks
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate quality before proceeding
