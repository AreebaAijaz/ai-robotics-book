# Specification Quality Checklist: RAG Chatbot with Text Selection

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Content Quality | PASS | Spec focuses on what/why, not how |
| Requirement Completeness | PASS | 14 functional requirements, all testable |
| Feature Readiness | PASS | 4 user stories with acceptance scenarios |

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
- All items pass validation - no clarification needed
- Tech stack details (FastAPI, Qdrant, OpenAI, etc.) intentionally excluded from spec per guidelines
- Implementation details will be captured in `plan.md` during planning phase
